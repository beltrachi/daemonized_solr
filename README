DaemonizedSolr
==============

Installation
============

Daemonized Solr is available as a plugin. For the
traditional plugin you can install like so (Rails 2.1 or later):

  script/plugin install git://github.com/beltrachi/daemonized_solr.git

For earlier versions:

  git clone git://github.com/beltrachi/daemonized_solr.git vendor/plugins/daemonized_solr

2. script/generate daemonized_solr_migration
3. rake db:migrate

Example
=======

To apply the daemonized updates to the solr models you want, you have to modify
the call to the acts_as_solr this way:

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_solr :offline => proc { |r| DaemonizedSolr::Update.register_on( r ) }
end

This way, all updates to the index will be stored in the database and processed
later.

To process the updates you have 2 options, a task runned by a cron or a daemon.

Rake task:

    > rake daemonized_solr:process_pending_updates

As daemon:
    You need to have the gem "daemons" installed and run the generator:
        > gem install daemons
        > script/generate daemonized_solr_daemon

    And run it as daemon with:
        > ./lib/daemonized_solr_processor_ctl start

    or 

        > script/daemons start


Development
===========

To develop on this plugin it has to be installed in a stub project as a plugin,
and the acts_as_solr plugin must be installed too.

    > rails stub_project
    > cd stub_project
    > script/plugin install git://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr.git
    > script/plugin install git://github.com/beltrachi/daemonized_solr.git

On TestDrivenDevelopment, the first thing to do is to get the tests running!

As this plugin is targeted to work on postgres only, the postgres plugin and 
server must be installed.

To pass the tests, a solr instance must be running, so invoke the one from the
stub project:
    > rake solr:start RAILS_ENV=test

To run the tests go to the daemonized_solr plugin folder in the stub project:
    > cd vendor/plugins/daemonized_solr
    > rake

If everything is fine then you can start developing!
